The name of webpage is index.html

Also it has some images included in it.

I have made a project as per your guidelines.

A header with comapny's logo as well as Home , About Us , How it works and Contact Us.

Below header, there is slider which has 4 to 5 different slides along with image and text on it.

The section below the fold contains information which can be reached when the user clicks on any of the menu items in the main menu.

The footer contains Name, address and contact number of the website owner and social connect icons like FB, Twitter, Linkedin, etc.
